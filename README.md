# Loan-Management-System Overview

This project focuses on designing a scalable data warehouse solution that consolidates loan, transaction, and customer information from both an old and new Loan Management System (LMS). The objective is to create a unified view for analysts while handling partial data migration, schema differences, and data integration challenges.
